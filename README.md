JSON Validation:
 

SDLC methodology used in this assignment:
The project starts by converting the 5 subjects HTML-files to JSON format then secondly developing a PHP program to read and display the data in JSON file by using a foreach loop to display all the elements inside of a <div> then create a button that will literally read back the content for each SCP subject using the speech browser API.
The layout was implementing by using Bootstrap classes.
